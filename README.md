* pytorch >= 1.0

You can download the required python packages by `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Dataset
**MSR-VTTT**

You have to save features from 3DCNN which have spatial and temporal dimensions beforehand.
First,  Please download the dataset from the link on (this page)[https://github.com/VisionLearningGroup/caption-guided-saliency/issues/6]
Then, you can extract features in MSR-VTT (using the codes from this repository)[https://github.com/yiskw713/video_feature_extractor].
